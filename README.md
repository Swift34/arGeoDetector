# arGeoDetector
Amateur Radio utility for converting GPS coordinates to grid square and county or independent city in realtime.

# Objective
The objective of arGeoDetector is to provide real time location telemetry to the operator during mobile contesting operations.  Never again get confused by unmarked county or city lines.  arGeoDetector is completely standalone and is not dependent on an internet connection.  The only hardware requirement is an NMEA compatible GPS dongle that presents itself as a serial port.  I have only been able to test with a few pieces of hardware, so if yours isn't working, please let me know.

# Maidenhead Grid Square
arGeoDetector currently provides a 6 character grid square.

# County or Independent City
arGeoDetector is able to parse country/city boundary files from NO5W availble [here](http://no5w.com/CQxCountyOverlays-DL.php)
